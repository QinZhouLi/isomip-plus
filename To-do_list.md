## Hackathon To-Do List

1. Discuss draft figures (see [Figure_outline.md](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/blob/main/Figure_outline.md) ), identify any missing analyses
2. Check data - some assumptions were made when assigning the data paths e.g. versions. Please check [this list](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/blob/main/notebooks/file-pointers/DataInformation.md). 
3. Model description for each model/group (including references), following MOM6 Example that Gustavo wrote. Potentially the same models submitted by different groups can have some common sections.
    1. COCO
    2. FVCOM
    3. MITgcm-BAS
    4. MITgcm_BAS_Coupled
    5. MITgcm-JPL
    6. MOM6-layer - done
    7. MOM6_SIGMA_ZSTAR - done
    8. MPAS-Ocean
    9. NEMO-UKESM1is
    10. NEMO-CNRS
    11. POP2x
    12. ROMS-UTAS
4. Finalise figures e.g. checking code, dealing with NaNs, proper time periods of averaging, use of subplots. There are some notebooks with draft versions of the figures, plus Xylar's code in the `general-plotting` folder (if the notebook you desire doesn't exist please make a new one!). 
5. Write descriptions about each of the figures on Overleaf for the results section, especially figures that won't qualitatively change
6. Discuss the results, give feedback
7. Someone to write the Introduction?
