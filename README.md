# ISOMIP+ Collaborative Analysis and Writing Project

Ten different modelling groups submitted results to the ISOMIP+ model intercomparison project, using the [Asay-Davis et al. (2016) protocol](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2471/2016/). This is a central repository where we can create and upload figures and the code used to generate them whilst analysing and describing the differences between ice-shelf ocean models. Discussions, figures and scripts are very welcome.

### How it works:
- Suggested figures for analysis are in the [Issues](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/issues) section. Feel free to assign yourself a figure, suggest ideas for new ones by creating a new issue, upload figures into the text box, and make comments and suggestions.
- [Figure_outline.md](https://github.com/misomip/isomip-plus/blob/main/Figures.md) contains a summary list of figures; this will be modified as we make progress.
- To contribute code, first fork this repository, then make your changes, and finally create a pull request back to the main repository to merge and share your work.

### Virtual Hackathon Schedule:
TBA
