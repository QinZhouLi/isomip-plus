In some places it is a little unclear which data should be used. Here are some notes about what is contained in the .txt files. The zipped Google Drive folder also contains some more files e.g. different versions.

- COCO's Ocean0 documentation says it should use \Gamma_T = 0.025, this is the file ....GT0025.nc
- MOM6 COM sigma zstar is taken from the MOM6 folder, as the attached PDF is more recent than that in the MOM6-SIGMA-ZSTAR folder
- MOM6 layer is used as both a COM and TYP experiment. **MOM6 results for melt rate, overturning etc are very different to the plots on OSF/Xylar's drive?**
- MITgcm JPL - not sure which file should be used since there is a file with the suffix 'new' as well.
- MITgcm BAS Coupled - using V3
